                            <p>A Theban Prophet, often seen with his golden scepter. Tiresias is well known for providing advice to some of the most important people in history, including Odysseus and Oedipus. If you are lucky enough, you may be able to see his shade around the House of Death, advising those who have significant journeys up ahead.</p>

                            <p>A king of Ephyra, known for his craftiness and deceitfulness. He cheated death two times, and thus ended up with the punishment of pushing a boulder up a mountain every day, just to have it roll back to the bottom, forcing him to restart. He is often seen with "sweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head" (194).</p>

                            <p>Agememnon was a famous field marshal who died at the hands of his brother, Aegisthus. His shade is quite noticable, as Odysseus described him as "fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades, troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him, who met their fate in lord Aegisthusâ€™ halls" (187). If you notice a large legion of soldiers around the underworld, there is a chance that Agamemnon may be there.</p>
