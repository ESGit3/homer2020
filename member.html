He was dunked in the River Styx by his mother in the hopes of making him invincible, with just his heel keeping him somewhat mortal. He died by an arrow hitting his heel, his only vulnerable spot, hence the term "Achilles Heel". </p>

He cheated death two times, and thus ended up with the punishment of pushing a boulder up a mountain every day, just to have it roll back to the bottom, forcing him to restart. He is often seen with "sweat drenching his body, dust swirling above his head" (194).</p>

                            <p>Agamemnon was a famous field marshal who died at the hands of his brother, Aegisthus, as well as his wife. His shade is quite noticable, as Odysseus described him as "fraught with grief and flanked by all his comrades, troops of his men-at-arms who died beside him, who met their fate in lord Aegisthus’ halls" (187). If you notice a large legion of soldiers around the underworld, there is a chance that Agamemnon may be there.</p>

Visitors to the Underworld will be able to see Tantalus suspended in the middle of a lake with fruits above him, but he will never be able to drink or eat as they just rise or fall out of reach. This unique punishment has been an attraction for many, and is a must-see for visitors.</p>
