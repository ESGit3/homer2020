                                    <p>One of the most popular activities in the Underworld is offering libations to the dead in
                                        order to meet the spirits of those who you wish to see. There is a simple process of digging
                                        "a trench of about a forearm’s depth and length and around it poured libations out to all
                                        the dead, first with milk and honey, and then with mellow wine, then water third and last,
                                        and sprinkled glistening barley over it all" (175). Afterwards, a couple of vows and prayers
                                        will invoke the spirits of the dead to come meet you. It is a wonderful experience for many
                                        and the possibilities of who to invoke are endless!</p>

                                    <p>A popular choice for those who decided to invoke spirits is to communicate with
                                        family members and friends that have already passed away. In the case of Odysseus,
                                        he was able to meet his mother and other famous people such as Tyro, Antiope,
                                        Alcmena, Epicaste, and Arete, among many others. Many of our visitors meet friends
                                        and family to gain advice or just to talk to them again, and you can too!</p>

                                    <p>A fairly popular attraction in the Underworld are the unusual punishments given out. Punishments such
                                        as Sisyphus and his boulder, Tantalus and his desire to eat and drink, Tityus and the vultures tearing
                                        at his liver, and the Danaides and their jugs of water attract many. These are among the few punishments
                                        on display here, with countless more you can witness. However, not everyone will enjoy watching the exotic
                                        punishments, so be sure to be comfortable with these situations before viewing. </p>
